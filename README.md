# Sample for Dynamic Query with ASP .NET CORE and EF Core

First Install Angular CLI Use the starting guide of https://cli.angular.io/

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Sadly visual studio does not yet allow to run npm install on a seperate folder, so start a command line in the folder spa, and run:

```
cd spa
npm i
```

Run ng build once to see if there is no errors in the folder spa
```
cd spa
ng build
```

if its all good you can start build + run the project and it should show the sample.
